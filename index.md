## Project Idea <a name = "projectidea"></a>
Bluetooth controlled mbed robot with similar functionality as a real car such as moving, turning, blinking lights to signal, honking horn, and collision detection.  

The robot will utilize the adafruit bluetooth app and module in order to be controlled. The robot will be able to be controlled for driving forwards, backwards, and turning. The robot will additionally have headlights and breaklights with different levels of brightness. The speaker can be controlled to honk. Additionally, the robot will feature a SONAR sensor in the front that will prevent crashing into objects. All functionality will be handled concurrently with mbed RTOS threads.

## Instructions <a name = "instructions"></a>
To recreate the project:  
1.  Build robot chassis with motors and attach breadboards as shown in pictures  
2.  Attach embed devices and wire appropriately according to [Hardware](#hardware)   
3.  Compile and load source code onto main mbed and sonar mbed  
4.  Connect battery packs to circuit to power mbed  
5.  Connect via BlueFruit Connect on android/iphone
