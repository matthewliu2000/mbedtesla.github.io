## Quick Bio <a name = "aboutme"></a>
Fourth year Computer Engineer at Georgia Tech with industry experience in hardware engineering specializing in pre-silicon validation within a microcontroller of an SoC. Adaptable, resourceful, and adept at working in focused and collaborative environments, debugging problems during testing, and creating or finding solutions. Actively looking for hardware design engineering internships and co-ops Spring and Summer 2022.  

My career goal is to immerse myself with state-of-the-art, comprehensive, interdisciplinary knowledge in computer engineering and computer science, and become well trained in integrating hardware and software, as well as application of engineering concepts and methods to computer systems engineering and design. I plan to pursue a graduate degree in ECE and/or seek a job in industry.

## Work Experience <a name = "work"></a> 

[Intel Corporation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) - RTL Validation Engineering Intern  
Intel is a multi-national technology company focusing on semiconductors, computer hardware, autonomous vehicles, automation, AI. Amid some stiff competition, Intel still holds massive market shares in server and PC chip design and manufacturing. I primarily worked on server-chip design and validation.
- Contributed to development of new BFM within pre-silicon validation environment for modeling power management firmware responses by improving code modularity and resuse and minimized reliance on firmware to validate RTL  
- For supported regression tests, the BFM reduces CPU model time by 27% and total cycles by 75%, enabling more efficient, more reliable, and timelier validation 
- Enabled validation tests for new generation of design
- Provided validation collateral to identify RTL security bugs
- Worked on identifying holes during code coverage analysis 
- Validation of a bridge between microcontrollers with multiple protocols layers and translations. Worked on new self-checking capabilities for old sequences, and scoreboard for data checks across serial wire.
- Formal validation of a resource controller and python script automation of code development. Also worked on creating script to reformat monitor prints for easier debug.
